# Loop Pattern: Counter Loop

READ SLIDE

Lets explore something a little more intresting. So fair we have seen example that has only printed each item, but we are not limited to print.

We can add other control flow statements, such as if statements.

Lets modify this loop to only print the even numbers.

modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder of dividing two numbers.

Even numbers divided by 2 never have a remainder while odd number always have a remainder.

```python
for i in range(6):
  if (i % 2 == 0):
    print(i)
```
