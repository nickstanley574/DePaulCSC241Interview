# Overview and Assumptions

* Let review what we are going to talk about today.

    * We will to do a quick list review. What they are and list indexing.

    * Using `lists` we are then going to explore what a `for` loop is and how it works.

    * We are going to introuce the built in range() method.

    * And then we are going to explore some loop pattern including counter, accumulator and index iteration.

*  For this talk I made some assumptions
    * One the audience has a basic understanding Python.
        * indentation, the `print()` statement, basic if else statements
        * basic Arithmetic operators and Comparison operators
        * You can think of this has a week 3-4 topic.

I used the "Introduction to Computering Using Python" by Prof. Perkovic to help develop this talk. 

With that lets get started with our list overview.
