# Overview and Assumptions

* Let review what we are going to talk about in  presentation.

    * We will to do a quick list review. What they are, and list indexing.

    * Using `list` we are then going to explore what a `for` loop is and now it works.

    * We are going to introuce the built in range() method.

    * And then we are going to explore some loop pattern including counter, accumulator and index iteration.

*  For this talk I made some assumptions

    * One the audience has a basic understanding Python.

        * indentation,   the `print()` statement, basic if else statements

        * basic Arithmetic operators and Comparison operators

        * You can think of this has a week 3 topic.
