# Loop Pattern: Accumulator Loop

The next for loop pattern we are going to explore is the accumulator loop.

This `for` loop “pattern” used to traverse a sequence, accumulating a value as we go, such as the sum-so-far 

The accumulation pattern includes:
* initializing an “accumulator” variable to an initial value.
* iterating thought the items in a sequence.
* updating the accumulator variable on each iteration.

Ours
* So in our case we we initialize our accumulator variable val.
* When the iterate over the items in numLst.
* Duing each iteration we update val.
