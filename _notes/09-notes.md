#  The `range()` Method

One of the built in methods that is used a lot with for loop in python in the `range()` method.

Similar to list indexing the range method starts at 0. If we say giving me `range(6)` it will give back 0,1,2,3,4,5. Notice there are 6 elements returned, and we start at `0` and end at `5`.

Again this is like list indexing at that is not accident. So keep that in mind.
