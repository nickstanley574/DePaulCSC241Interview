# Variable in `<sequence>`

In the pervious example we saw a list hardcoded in the `<sequence>` position of the for loop.

That is not a rule of for loops, in fact is not even the norm.

Ussually we put a variable or method into the <sequence> position that refers to or returns a iterable.

Here we can see the same loop has before but instead of having the list hardcoded were are using the `vehicles` variable
