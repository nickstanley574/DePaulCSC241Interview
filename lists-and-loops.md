## Quick List Overview

We humble human need to keep track of multiple things in our daily lives and to do that we make lists, a todo list, shopping list, a book list.

In programming sometime you need to do the same thing and keep track of multiple values.

To accomplish this, Python as a built in type and, because we programmers are unimaginative and like quick and effective communication, it called you guest it a list.

A list in python is just a sequence of objects for example: `vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']`

Lists are represented as a comma-separated sequence enclosed with square brackets.

```
vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
#          ▲   ▲   ▲                       ▲
#          |   |   |                       |
#          |   |   |                       +--- end of list with closed square bracket ]
#          |   |   |
#          |   |   +--------------------------- comma-separates items ,
#          |   |
#          |   +------------------------------- item in a list can be any type they are strings
#          |
#          +----------------------------------- start of list with open square bracket [

```

A list's items are indexed starting a zero. You can also thing of index has position. Like get me the item at position 2.
```
# index:
#              0       1       2       3
vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
```
To access individual items in the list we can use the indexing operator `list[index]`.

Lets access `'trains'` which is the 2nd item, but b/c indexing starts at 0 the 2nd item is at position 1.
```
>>> vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
>>> vehicles[1]
>>> 'train'
```

Joke?

Lists are incredibly powerful objects and have a lot of built in methods to solve a whole host of problems, but for the purpose of this talk we are going to skip over them and focus on `for` loop and use the list to explore `for` list usability.


## `for` Loop

The `for` loop can be used to iterate over the items of a list.

iterate - the act of repeating; a repetition. its when you do something over and over again.

In programing we call objects that can be iterated over **iterable**.

```
for <variable> in <sequence>:
    <indented code block>
<non-indented statement>
```

The `<sequence>` must refer to an object that can be iterated over, for this introduction we are only going use `lists` for the sequence, but keep in mind there are many python objects that are iterable you will learn about later.

When the for loop is executed  it assigns the values in the `<sequence>` to `<variable>` one by one. Anything in the `<indented code block>` will be executed every time the loop runs until the last time in the `<sequence>` is reached.

Lets explore our first of many for loops.

### Loop 1 - 'list' in `<sequence>`
```
print('Start.')

for i in ['sedan','train','truck','plane']:
    print(i)

print('Done.')
```
In this first example we can see `i` in the `<variable>` position with our familiar vehicles list in the `<sequence>` position and a print statement with `i` in the `<indented code block>`.

Lets run it:
```
--- output ---

Start.
sedan
train
truck
plane
Done.
```
It prints all the values in the list.

Lets look at another version of the same list.

### Loop 2 - List Variable in `<sequence>`
```
print('Start.')

vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
for i in vehicles:
    print(i)

print('Done.')
```
In this one you can see instead of having the list itself in the `<sequence>` section we have the `vehicles` variable which is the same list defined above the for loop.
```
--- output ---
Start.
sedan
train
truck
plane
Done.
```
This illiterates the `<sequence>` can use iterable variables in our case a list variable.

Lets make another change.

### Loop 3 - `<variable>` Definition

#### Loop 3a
```
print('Start.')

vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
for v in vehicles:
    print(v)

print('Done.')
```
We changed the `<variable>` from `i` to `v`. The `<variable>` doesn't need to be `i` it can be any variable.
```
--- output ---
Start.
sedan
train
truck
plane
Done.
```
`<variable>` can even be something like `vehicle_var`
#### Loop 3b
```
print('Start.')

vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
for vehicle_var in vehicles:
    print(vehicle_var)

print('Done.')
```
Yet again the same behavior.
```
--- output ---
Start.
sedan
train
truck
plane
Done.
```

### Loop 4 - No `<variable>` in `<indented code block>`

Even thought we have used the for loop `<variable>` in the `<indented code block>` in every example so far that is not a requirement of `for` loops.

#### Loop 4a
```
print('Start.')

vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
for vehicle_var in vehicles:
    print("hello")

print('Done.')
```
Here we can see the output is 4 hellos.
```
--- output ---
Start.
hello
hello
hello
hello
Done.
```

#### Loop 4b
```
print('Start.')

vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
for vehicle_var in vehicles:
    x = 1

print('Done.')
```
```
--- output ---
Start.
Done.
```

## The `range()` Function

One of the builtin methods used a lot with Python for loops is `range()`. 

`range()` allows users to generate a object of numbers within a given range.

We can put `range()` in the `<sequence>` section of a `for` b/c it returns a iterable object.

```
# create a sequence of 6 integers, and print each item in the sequence:
for i in range(6):
    print(i)

--- output ---
0
1
2
3
4
5
```
Notice that we get `0,1,2,3,4,5`, but not `6`. the reason why is b/c `range(6)` says give me the first `6` integers, but again we start indexing at `0`. You can see there are indeed `6` items in the list, but that means we stop at `5`.

> In case it comes up range() changed between python2 and python3. In python2 `range()` returns a list, in python3 it now returns a range object. python2: `print(range(3)) -> [0,1,2]` in python3 `print(range(3)) -> range(0,3)` which is still iterable and works the same way.


## Counter Loop

We use the counter pattern when we need to execute a block of code for every integer is some range. The pervious `range()` example was a simple counter loop. lets 

```
for i in range(6):
    if (i % 2) == 0:
        print(i)

--- output ---
0
2
4
```

## Accumulator Loop

* A common pattern in loops is to accumulate a value in every iteration of the loop.
* To accomplish this wee need a variable defined outside of the for loop that is modified during every for loop iteration.

```
numLst = [2, 4, 3, 7]
sum = 0
for n in numLst:
    sum = sum + n
print(sum)

--- output ---
16

```

The `sum` is *incremented* by the value of `num`.



```
numLst = [ 2, 4, 3, 7 ]     |    sum = 0

n      =   2                |    sum = sum + n
                            |    sum =  0  + 2 = 2
 
n      =      4             |    sum = sum + n
                            |    sum =  2  + 4 = 6
 
n      =         3          |    sum = sum + n
                            |    sum =  6  + 3 = 9
 
n      =            7       |    sum = sum + n
                            |    sum =  9  + 7 = 16
```

```
n = 10
power = 3
valueLst = []
for value in range(n):
 if(value % power == 0):
     valueLst.append(value)
print(valueLst)

--- output ---
[0, 3, 6, 9]
```
