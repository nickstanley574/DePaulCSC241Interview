### Assumptions

* The audience already has a basic understanding of the Python syntax üêç.
    * indentation
    * `print()`
    * variable expressions: `x = 1 `

* Let review what we are going to talk about in  presentation.

    * We will to do a quick list review. What they are, and list indexing.

    * Using `list` we are then going to explore what a `for` loop is and now it works.

    * We are going to introuce the built in range() method.

    * And then we are going to explore some loop pattern including counter, accumulator and index iteration.

*  For this talk I made some assumptions

    * One the audience has a basic understanding Python.

        * indentation,   the `print()` statement

        * basic if else statements

        * basic Arithmetic operators and Comparison operators,
