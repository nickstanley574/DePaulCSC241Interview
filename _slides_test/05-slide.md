# `list` Overview: `len()`

The `len()` function returns the number of items in a list.

```python
>>> vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
>>> len(vehicles)
>>> 4
>>>
>>> nums = [1,3,4,2,7,2]
>>> len(nums)
>>> 6
```

len is a function buit into python that returns the number if items the list.

Lists are incredibly powerful objects and have a lot of built in methods to solve a whole host of problems, but for the purpose of this talk we are going to move foward to the `for` loop and use lists to explore `for` usability.
