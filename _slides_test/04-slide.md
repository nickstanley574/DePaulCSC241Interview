# Quick List Overview

A list's items are indexed starting a `0`.
{% highlight python %}
# index:
#              0       1       2       3
vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
{% endhighlight %}


Indexing operator: `list[index]`.

Lets access `'trains'` which is the 2nd item, but b/c indexing starts at `0` the 2nd item is at index `1`.
{% highlight python %}
>>> vehicles = ['sedan','train','truck','plane']
>>> vehicles[1]
>>> 'train'
{% endhighlight %}
