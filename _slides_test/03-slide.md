# Quick `list` Overview

A list in python is just a sequence of objects.

Lists are represented as a comma-separated sequence enclosed with square brackets.

```python

#          +----------------------------------- start of list with open square bracket [
#          |
#          |   +------------------------------- item in a list can be any type they are strings
#          |   |
#          |   |   +--------------------------- comma-separates items ,
#          |   |   |
#          |   |   |                       +--- end of list with closed square bracket ]
#          |   |   |                       |

We humble human need to keep track of multiple things in our daily
lives and to do that we make lists, a todo list, shopping list, a book list.

In programming sometime you need to do the same thing and keep track of multiple values.

To accomplish this, Python as a built in type and, because
we programmers are unimaginative and like quick and effective
 communication, it called you guest it a list.
